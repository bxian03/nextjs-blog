On September 2nd, I participated in my first hackathon with friends.

For our project when we thought of a bot that could help with school we immediately remembered our amazing high school chemistry teacher and the struggle we faced with learning organic chemistry. Our bot combats this and makes learning IUPAC names for Organic Compounds a fun way to study with peers.
